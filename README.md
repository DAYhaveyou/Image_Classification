# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

This project provides a teaching demo code platform for image recognition, which also matians two visual tools, namely, CAM and T-SNE. We hope that any novice can implement his/her own deep learning framework through learning the sample but useful project, applying to subsequent specific tasks. As you get deeper into neural network, you'll see it is amazing and strong whiles confusing. Here, good luck to us!
